# Hello

👋 I'm a software tinkerer with a passion for infra, security, and self-hosting.

This is a space where I document my learnings and share them with others. I hope you find something useful here. Continuous improvement is what motivates me to keep learning.

I choose to host this site, alongside other tools, rather than relying exclusively on larger platforms because I believe in the open web. Interoperability is often not a consideration for popular platforms today and I find that concerning.
