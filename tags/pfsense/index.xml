This has been running fine with a single onboard Intel NIC. A few months ago, I upgraded to a machine that has a CPU that supports hardware-accelerated transcoding, has more SATA ports, and has more PCI slots for future expansion. With the goal of having a dedicated NIC for WAN, I bought an inexpensive 1Gbps PCIe NIC (TG-3468) despite reading about some of the concerns around Realtek NICs (sluggish performance, driver instability, and in some cases system crashes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running a Realtek NICs reliably on Linux and Windows desktops, so I figured I could make it work without too much effort, but it turns out Realtek NICs really can be problematic when it comes to FreeBSD-based routers, and commonly documented workarounds did not solve my problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Virtualizing my router with pfSense</title><link>/blog/virtualizing-a-router-with-pfsense/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 18:50:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/virtualizing-a-router-with-pfsense/</guid><description>&lt;p>My aging router has been running &lt;a

I&amp;rsquo;ve also recently been experiencing instability with my router (likely the result of a combination of configuration tweaking and firmware updating). OpenWrt has served me well, but it is time to move on!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
