This has been running fine with a single onboard Intel NIC. A few months ago, I upgraded to a machine that has a CPU that supports hardware-accelerated transcoding, has more SATA ports, and has more PCI slots for future expansion. With the goal of having a dedicated NIC for WAN, I bought an inexpensive 1Gbps PCIe NIC (TG-3468) despite reading about some of the concerns around Realtek NICs (sluggish performance, driver instability, and in some cases system crashes).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been running a Realtek NICs reliably on Linux and Windows desktops, so I figured I could make it work without too much effort, but it turns out Realtek NICs really can be problematic when it comes to FreeBSD-based routers, and commonly documented workarounds did not solve my problems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Virtualizing my router with pfSense</title><link>/blog/virtualizing-a-router-with-pfsense/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 18:50:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/virtualizing-a-router-with-pfsense/</guid><description>&lt;p>My aging router has been running &lt;a

>OpenWrt&lt;/a> for years and for the most part has been quite reliable. OpenWrt is an open-source project used on embedded devices to route network traffic. It supports many different configurations and there exists a &lt;a

I&amp;rsquo;ve also recently been experiencing instability with my router (likely the result of a combination of configuration tweaking and firmware updating). OpenWrt has served me well, but it is time to move on!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running K3s in LXC on Proxmox</title><link>/blog/running-k3s-in-lxc-on-proxmox/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 10:07:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>/blog/running-k3s-in-lxc-on-proxmox/</guid><description>It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve actively used Kubernetes and wanted to explore the evolution of tools such as Helm and Tekton. I decided to deploy K3s, since I&amp;rsquo;ve had success with deploying it on resource-contrained Raspberry Pis in the past. I thought that this time it&amp;rsquo;d be convenient to have K3s running in a LXC container on Proxmox. This would allow for easy snapshotting of the entire Kubernetes deployment.</description></item><item><title>What to do with a homelab</title><link>/blog/what-to-do-with-a-homelab/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 01:12:54 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/what-to-do-with-a-homelab/</guid><description>&lt;p>A homelab can be an inexpensive way to host a multitude of internal/external services and learn &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> in the process.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
