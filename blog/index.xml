And by conveniently, I mean that I&amp;rsquo;d rather not have to spin up an ephemeral virtual machine running in the same network and proxy the connection, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to use a local client (preferably with a GUI). After several web searches, it became evident that Azure does not readily provide much tooling to support this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Watching YouTube in private</title><link>/blog/watching-youtube-in-private/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2022 21:46:55 -0500</pubDate><guid>/blog/watching-youtube-in-private/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently stumbled upon &lt;a

I&amp;rsquo;ve also recently been experiencing instability with my router (likely the result of a combination of configuration tweaking and firmware updating). OpenWrt has served me well, but it is time to move on!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Backing up gmail with Synology</title><link>/blog/backing-up-gmail-with-synology/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Mar 2022 18:49:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/backing-up-gmail-with-synology/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve used gmail since the beta launched touting a whopping 1GB of storage. I thought this was a massive leap in email technology at the time. I was lucky enough to get an invite fairly quickly. Not suprisingly, I have many years of emails, attachments, and photos. I certainly do not want to lose the content of many of these emails. Despite the redundancy of the data that Google secures, I still feel better retaining a copy of this data on my own physical machines.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running K3s in LXC on Proxmox</title><link>/blog/running-k3s-in-lxc-on-proxmox/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 10:07:03 -0500</pubDate><guid>/blog/running-k3s-in-lxc-on-proxmox/</guid><description>It has been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve actively used Kubernetes and wanted to explore the evolution of tools such as Helm and Tekton. I decided to deploy K3s, since I&amp;rsquo;ve had success with deploying it on resource-contrained Raspberry Pis in the past. I thought that this time it&amp;rsquo;d be convenient to have K3s running in a LXC container on Proxmox. This would allow for easy snapshotting of the entire Kubernetes deployment.</description></item><item><title>Replacing docker with podman on macOS (and Linux)</title><link>/blog/replacing-docker-with-podman-on-macos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 10:43:35 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/replacing-docker-with-podman-on-macos/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are a number of reasons why you might want to replace docker, especially on macOS.

This morning, I read a question about automatically rotating AWS Access Keys without having to go through the hassle of navigating the AWS console. There are some existing solutions already, but I decided to write a script since it was incredibly simple. The script could be packed up as a systemd/launchd service to continually rotate access keys in the background.
In the longer term, migrating my local workflows to aws-vault seems like a more secure solution.</description></item><item><title>Why I threw out my dotfiles</title><link>/blog/why-i-threw-out-my-dotfiles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:42:33 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/why-i-threw-out-my-dotfiles/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the years I have collected a number of dotfiles that I have shared across both Linux and macOS machines (&lt;code>~/.zshrc&lt;/code>, &lt;code>~/.config/git/config&lt;/code>, &lt;code>~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf&lt;/code>, etc).
